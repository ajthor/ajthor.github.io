  abstract = 	 {We present a data-driven algorithm for efficiently computing stochastic control policies for general joint chance constrained optimal control problems. Our approach leverages the theory of kernel distribution embeddings, which allows representing expectation operators as inner products in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. This framework enables approximately reformulating the original problem using a dataset of observed trajectories from the system without imposing prior assumptions on the parameterization of the system dynamics or the structure of the uncertainty. By optimizing over a finite subset of stochastic open-loop control trajectories, we relax the original problem to a linear program over the control parameters that can be efficiently solved using standard convex optimization techniques. We demonstrate our proposed approach in simulation on a system with nonlinear non-Markovian dynamics navigating in a cluttered environment.}

  abstract = 	 {We present a data-driven method for computing approximate forward reachable sets using separating kernels in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. We frame the problem as a support estimation problem, and learn a classifier of the support as an element in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space using a data-driven approach. Kernel methods provide a computationally efficient representation for the classifier that is the solution to a regularized least squares problem. The solution converges almost surely as the sample size increases, and admits known finite sample bounds. This approach is applicable to stochastic systems with arbitrary disturbances and neural network verification problems by treating the network as a dynamical system, or by considering neural network controllers as part of a closed-loop system. We present our technique on several examples, including a spacecraft rendezvous and docking problem, and two nonlinear system benchmarks with neural network controllers.}

abstract = {We present SOCKS, a data-driven stochastic optimal control toolbox based in kernel methods. SOCKS is a collection of data-driven algorithms that compute approximate solutions to stochastic optimal control problems with arbitrary cost and constraint functions, including stochastic reachability, which seeks to determine the likelihood that a system will reach a desired target set while respecting a set of pre-defined safety constraints. Our approach relies upon a class of machine learning algorithms based in kernel methods, a nonparametric technique which can be used to represent probability distributions in a high-dimensional space of functions known as a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. As a nonparametric technique, kernel methods are inherently data-driven, meaning that they do not place prior assumptions on the system dynamics or the structure of the uncertainty. This makes the toolbox amenable to a wide variety of systems, including those with nonlinear dynamics, black-box elements, and poorly characterized stochastic disturbances. We present the main features of SOCKS and demonstrate its capabilities on several benchmarks.},

abstract = {Variability in human response creates non-trivial challenges for modeling and control of human-automation systems. As autonomy becomes pervasive, methods that can accommodate human variability will become paramount, to ensure efficiency, safety, and high levels of performance. We propose an easily computable modeling framework which takes advantage of a metric to assess variability in individual human response in a dynamic task that participants repeat over several trials. Our approach is based in a transformation of observed trajectories to a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, which captures variability in human response as a distribution embedded within the Hilbert space. We evaluate the similarity across responses via the maximum mean discrepancy, which measures the distance between distributions within the Hilbert space. We apply this metric to a difficult driving task designed to elucidate differences across participants. We conducted a pilot study with 6 participants in an advanced driving simulator, in which participants were tasked with collision avoidance of an obstacle in the middle of the road, around a blind corner, in a nighttime scenario, while steering only with the non-dominant hand.}
