abstract={Autonomous systems are increasingly being deployed in complex environments subject to real-world uncertainty. For such systems, it may be exceptionally difficult or even impossible to compute a simple mathematical model of the system--for instance due to the presence of human elements, complex mechanics or system dynamics, or learning-enabled components. Data-driven control has recently gained significant attention in this area, where observations taken from the system evolution are used to compute an implicit representation of the system that is amenable to analysis and control. However, data-driven algorithms for control present new challenges, and require new insights to enable their use. The primary focus of this thesis are algorithms for data-driven control based in the theory of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. Specifically, we focus on using data to compute empirical estimates of key statistical quantities in stochastic optimal control problems based in the framework of kernel embeddings of distributions. We demonstrate that such kernel-based techniques are applicable for a wide variety of approximate stochastic optimal control problems of interest, including chance-constrained control and dynamic programming. Current approaches to data-driven control are often limited to finite action spaces, linear dynamics, or Gaussian disturbances. In contrast, our approach can handle nonlinear dynamics and arbitrary stochastic disturbances, and imposes minimal assumptions. Moreover, our approach is computationally efficient, and enables stochastic policy synthesis that can be solved as a linear program in Hilbert space. In addition, we developed tools for kernel-based control in a publicly-available, open source toolbox called SOCKS, that implements all algorithms presented in this thesis. We also present an approach to data-driven safety analysis of stochastic systems using the theory of stochastic reachability. Stochastic reachability seeks to provide probabilistic assurances of safety, i.e. the likelihood that a system will reach a desired goal while respecting pre-specified safety constraints. We develop kernel-based algorithms to approximate and solve the backward stochastic reachability problem in a model-free manner. We also discuss the problem of incorporating known, prior information of the system dynamics in the form of side information into the learning problem. Oftentimes, naive implementations of data-driven techniques fail to take into account important features which are known a priori about the system dynamics. Such knowledge is known as side information, and is typically derived from physical properties of the system model, e.g. symmetry, algebraic constraints on the dynamics, or knowledge of particular regions of the vector field. We present methods which augment the learning problem to incorporate such knowledge.},

title = {Additively Manufactured Electrochemical Plating Enclosures},
journal = {ECS Meeting Abstracts},
abstract = {Additively manufactured plating enclosures can be used as a cheap alternative to traditional plating tanks and fixturing, which can reduce the volume of chemistry required, allow for complex fluid dynamics across the part surface, and offer the possibility of augmenting and tuning the thermal gradients and electrical fields surrounding the part. Selective tank geometries allow for electrodes that can be integrated or conformally shaped onto the enclosure. By allowing for such diverse electrode geometries, these enclosures create the possibility of near-uniform electric fields for complex parts, unique electrical contact mechanisms that can be integrated into the enclosure itself, as well as accurate and minimally invasive part fittings to maintain part alignment during the plating process. 

Several commercially-available thermoplastics and photopolymers were analyzed for compatibility with a variety of chemistries commonly used in the electrodeposition processes. Preliminary testing and analysis of custom polymer plating enclosures was performed to demonstrate process viability. Parylene coatings can further increase the chemical resistance of the enclosure, leading to a wider range of chemistries which the custom polymer enclosures are resistant to. Further, polymer metallization and evaporation techniques offer the possibility of directly incorporating electrodes into the fixture itself, as well as for creating thermal contacts with external heat sources. 

Together, these techniques create the possibility of creating more uniform parts and coatings, while reducing chemical waste, material and equipment cost, and development time for laboratory-scale electroplating processes.
