abstract = {Partially autonomous driving systems often require the human driver to take control at any moment, yet by their design, often cause difficulty with attention management. In this preliminary study, we propose a data- and dynamics-driven approach to characterize driving performance in a partially autonomous vehicle during a manual braking event, under attentive or mind wandering states. A 10-participant experiment was completed in an advanced driving simulator. We employ a non-parametric learning technique, conditional distribution embeddings, to the driving simulator data, to evaluate likelihood of successfully completing the braking maneuver, under both attentive and mind wandering states. Our approach shows a statistically significant difference in braking profiles during mind wandering and non-mind wandering episodes for each participant. Our results reveal that heterogeneity in driving performance may have important implications for the design of autonomy that is responsive to attentional states. Data-driven tools, such as the one proposed here, may be useful in designing participant-specific alerts and warnings for control handovers and other safety-critical maneuvers, because of their potential to accommodate heterogeneous response.},

Kernel methods provide a computationally efficient representation for the classifier that is the solution to a regularized least squares problem. The solution converges almost surely as the sample size increases, and admits known finite sample bounds. This approach is applicable to stochastic systems with arbitrary disturbances and neural network verification problems by treating the network as a dynamical system, or by considering neural network controllers as part of a closed-loop system.

SOCKS is a collection of data-driven algorithms that compute approximate solutions to stochastic optimal control problems with arbitrary cost and constraint functions, including stochastic reachability, which seeks to determine the likelihood that a system will reach a desired target set while respecting a set of pre-defined safety constraints. Our approach relies upon a class of machine learning algorithms based in kernel methods, a nonparametric technique which can be used to represent probability distributions in a high-dimensional space of functions known as a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. As a nonparametric technique, kernel methods are inherently data-driven, meaning that they do not place prior assumptions on the system dynamics or the structure of the uncertainty. This makes the toolbox amenable to a wide variety of systems, including those with nonlinear dynamics, black-box elements, and poorly characterized stochastic disturbances. We present the main features of SOCKS and demonstrate its capabilities on several benchmarks.},

abstract = {Variability in human response creates non-trivial challenges for modeling and control of human-automation systems. As autonomy becomes pervasive, methods that can accommodate human variability will become paramount, to ensure efficiency, safety, and high levels of performance. We propose an easily computable modeling framework which takes advantage of a metric to assess variability in individual human response in a dynamic task that participants repeat over several trials. Our approach is based in a transformation of observed trajectories to a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, which captures variability in human response as a distribution embedded within the Hilbert space. We evaluate the similarity across responses via the maximum mean discrepancy, which measures the distance between distributions within the Hilbert space. We apply this metric to a difficult driving task designed to elucidate differences across participants. We conducted a pilot study with 6 participants in an advanced driving simulator, in which participants were tasked with collision avoidance of an obstacle in the middle of the road, around a blind corner, in a nighttime scenario, while steering only with the non-dominant hand.}

Our approach uses a nonparametric technique known as kernel distribution embeddings, and provides probabilistic assurances of safety for stochastic systems in a model-free manner. By implicitly embedding the stochastic kernel of a Markov control process in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, we can approximate the safety probabilities for stochastic systems with arbitrary stochastic disturbances as simple matrix operations and inner products. We present finite sample bounds for point-based approximations of the safety probabilities through construction of probabilistic confidence bounds that are state- and input-dependent. One advantage of this approach is that the bounds are responsive to non-uniformly sampled data, meaning that tighter bounds are feasible in regions of the state- and input-space with more observations. We numerically evaluate the approach, and demonstrate its efficacy on a neural network-controlled pendulum system.}

abstract={Autonomous systems are increasingly being deployed in complex environments subject to real-world uncertainty. For such systems, it may be exceptionally difficult or even impossible to compute a simple mathematical model of the system--for instance due to the presence of human elements, complex mechanics or system dynamics, or learning-enabled components. Data-driven control has recently gained significant attention in this area, where observations taken from the system evolution are used to compute an implicit representation of the system that is amenable to analysis and control. However, data-driven algorithms for control present new challenges, and require new insights to enable their use. The primary focus of this thesis are algorithms for data-driven control based in the theory of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. Specifically, we focus on using data to compute empirical estimates of key statistical quantities in stochastic optimal control problems based in the framework of kernel embeddings of distributions. We demonstrate that such kernel-based techniques are applicable for a wide variety of approximate stochastic optimal control problems of interest, including chance-constrained control and dynamic programming. Current approaches to data-driven control are often limited to finite action spaces, linear dynamics, or Gaussian disturbances. In contrast, our approach can handle nonlinear dynamics and arbitrary stochastic disturbances, and imposes minimal assumptions. Moreover, our approach is computationally efficient, and enables stochastic policy synthesis that can be solved as a linear program in Hilbert space. In addition, we developed tools for kernel-based control in a publicly-available, open source toolbox called SOCKS, that implements all algorithms presented in this thesis. We also present an approach to data-driven safety analysis of stochastic systems using the theory of stochastic reachability. Stochastic reachability seeks to provide probabilistic assurances of safety, i.e. the likelihood that a system will reach a desired goal while respecting pre-specified safety constraints. We develop kernel-based algorithms to approximate and solve the backward stochastic reachability problem in a model-free manner. We also discuss the problem of incorporating known, prior information of the system dynamics in the form of side information into the learning problem. Oftentimes, naive implementations of data-driven techniques fail to take into account important features which are known a priori about the system dynamics. Such knowledge is known as side information, and is typically derived from physical properties of the system model, e.g. symmetry, algebraic constraints on the dynamics, or knowledge of particular regions of the vector field. We present methods which augment the learning problem to incorporate such knowledge.},

abstract = {Additively manufactured plating enclosures can be used as a cheap alternative to traditional plating tanks and fixturing, which can reduce the volume of chemistry required, allow for complex fluid dynamics across the part surface, and offer the possibility of augmenting and tuning the thermal gradients and electrical fields surrounding the part. Selective tank geometries allow for electrodes that can be integrated or conformally shaped onto the enclosure. By allowing for such diverse electrode geometries, these enclosures create the possibility of near-uniform electric fields for complex parts, unique electrical contact mechanisms that can be integrated into the enclosure itself, as well as accurate and minimally invasive part fittings to maintain part alignment during the plating process. 

Several commercially-available thermoplastics and photopolymers were analyzed for compatibility with a variety of chemistries commonly used in the electrodeposition processes. Preliminary testing and analysis of custom polymer plating enclosures was performed to demonstrate process viability. Parylene coatings can further increase the chemical resistance of the enclosure, leading to a wider range of chemistries which the custom polymer enclosures are resistant to. Further, polymer metallization and evaporation techniques offer the possibility of directly incorporating electrodes into the fixture itself, as well as for creating thermal contacts with external heat sources. 

Together, these techniques create the possibility of creating more uniform parts and coatings, while reducing chemical waste, material and equipment cost, and development time for laboratory-scale electroplating processes.
