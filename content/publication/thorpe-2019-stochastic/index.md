abstract: "We present a solution to the first-hitting time stochastic reachability problem for extremely high-dimensional stochastic dynamical systems. Our approach takes advantage of a nonparametric learning technique known as conditional distribution embeddings to model the stochastic kernel using a data-driven approach. By embedding the dynamics and uncertainty within a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, it becomes possible to compute the safety probabilities for stochastic reachability problems as simple matrix operations and inner products. We employ a convergent approximation technique, random Fourier features, in order to accommodate the large sample sets needed for high-dimensional systems. This technique avoids the curse of dimensionality, and enables the computation of safety probabilities for high-dimensional systems without prior knowledge of the structure of the dynamics or uncertainty. We validate this approach on a double integrator system, and demonstrate its capabilities on a million-dimensional, nonlinear, non-Gaussian, repeated planar quadrotor system."
