We employ a nonparametric representation of the stochastic kernel as a conditional distribution embedding within a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). This representation avoids intractable integrals in the dynamic recursion of the stochastic reachability problem since the expectations can be calculated as an inner product within the RKHS. We demonstrate this approach on a high-dimensional chain of integrators and on Clohessy-Wiltshire-Hill dynamics.","tags":null,"title":"Model-Free Stochastic Reachability Using Kernel Distribution Embeddings","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Adam J Thorpe","Vignesh Sivaramakrishnan","Meeko MK Oishi"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"25212b77996ebf94cb3954f6942631d4","permalink":"https://ajthor.github.io/publication/thorpe-2019-stochastic/","publishdate":"2019-12-09T22:51:31.455114Z","relpermalink":"/publication/thorpe-2019-stochastic/","section":"publication","summary":"We present a solution to the first-hitting time stochastic reachability problem for extremely high-dimensional stochastic dynamical systems. Our approach takes advantage of a nonparametric learning technique known as conditional distribution embeddings to model the stochastic kernel using a data-driven approach. By embedding the dynamics and uncertainty within a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, it becomes possible to compute the safety probabilities for stochastic reachability problems as simple matrix operations and inner products. We employ a convergent approximation technique, random Fourier features, in order to accommodate the large sample sets needed for high-dimensional systems. This technique avoids the curse of dimensionality, and enables the computation of safety probabilities for high-dimensional systems without prior knowledge of the structure of the dynamics or uncertainty. We validate this approach on a double integrator system, and demonstrate its capabilities on a million-dimensional, nonlinear, non-Gaussian, repeated planar quadrotor system.","tags":null,"title":"Stochastic Reachability for Systems up to a Million Dimensions","type":"publication"}]
