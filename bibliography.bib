  abstract  = {We present SOCKS, a data-driven stochastic optimal control toolbox based in kernel methods. SOCKS is a collection of data-driven algorithms that compute approximate solutions to stochastic optimal control problems with arbitrary cost and constraint functions, including stochastic reachability, which seeks to determine the likelihood that a system will reach a desired target set while respecting a set of pre-defined safety constraints. Our approach relies upon a class of machine learning algorithms based in kernel methods, a nonparametric technique which can be used to represent probability distributions in a high-dimensional space of functions known as a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. As a nonparametric technique, kernel methods are inherently data-driven, meaning that they do not place prior assumptions on the system dynamics or the structure of the uncertainty. This makes the toolbox amenable to a wide variety of systems, including those with nonlinear dynamics, black-box elements, and poorly characterized stochastic disturbances. We present the main features of SOCKS and demonstrate its capabilities on several benchmarks.},

  abstract  = { This research investigates how brain activation in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) changes with learning stages in a psychomotor task. Utilizing functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), we measure prefrontal cortex activation in participants engaged in the simulated landing of a quadrotor, a complex system whose dynamics are non-intuitive for novices. Our findings indicate a significant decrease in PFC activation as learners progress from novice to proficient stages, suggesting a reduction in cognitive load that is correlated with performance improvements in the landing task. These insights could inform the design of future systems that optimize learning interventions based on cognitive state assessments. }

We frame the problem as a support estimation problem, and learn a classifier of the support as an element in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space using a data-driven approach. Kernel methods provide a computationally efficient representation for the classifier that is the solution to a regularized least squares problem. The solution converges almost surely as the sample size increases, and admits known finite sample bounds. This approach is applicable to stochastic systems with arbitrary disturbances and neural network verification problems by treating the network as a dynamical system, or by considering neural network controllers as part of a closed-loop system. We present our technique on several examples, including a spacecraft rendezvous and docking problem, and two nonlinear system benchmarks with neural network controllers.},

Our approach leverages the theory of kernel distribution embeddings, which allows representing expectation operators as inner products in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. This framework enables approximately reformulating the original problem using a dataset of observed trajectories from the system without imposing prior assumptions on the parameterization of the system dynamics or the structure of the uncertainty. By optimizing over a finite subset of stochastic open-loop control trajectories, we relax the original problem to a linear program over the control parameters that can be efficiently solved using standard convex optimization techniques. We demonstrate our proposed approach in simulation on a system with nonlinear non-Markovian dynamics navigating in a cluttered environment.}

Our approach uses a nonparametric technique known as kernel distribution embeddings, and provides probabilistic assurances of safety for stochastic systems in a model-free manner. By implicitly embedding the stochastic kernel of a Markov control process in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, we can approximate the safety probabilities for stochastic systems with arbitrary stochastic disturbances as simple matrix operations and inner products. We present finite sample bounds for point-based approximations of the safety probabilities through construction of probabilistic confidence bounds that are state- and input-dependent. One advantage of this approach is that the bounds are responsive to non-uniformly sampled data, meaning that tighter bounds are feasible in regions of the state- and input-space with more observations. We numerically evaluate the approach, and demonstrate its efficacy on a neural network-controlled pendulum system.},
