I am a postdoctoral researcher at the ODEN Institute for Computation & Science at the University of Texas at Austin. I received my Ph.D. in 2023 from the University of New Mexico. My dissertation was on methods for data-driven stochastic optimal control using Hilbert space embeddings of distributions. 

My expertise lies at the intersection of data-driven methods for control, human-centered autonomy, and statistical machine learning techniques.

## Research

My past research focused on techniques to solve stochastic optimal control problems as linear programs, confronting difficult problems in modeling, optimization, and controller synthesis using a principled statistical learning approach. In ongoing research, I am actively engaged in bridging the gap between data-driven and model-based control in order to overcome the inherent limitations caused by data availability. I am also interested in developing methods that incorporate human-centered principles in autonomy design. Using tools from functional analysis, I aim to design controllers which are responsive to user needs and preferences.
