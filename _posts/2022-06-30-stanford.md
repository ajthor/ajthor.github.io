I gave a talk in June 2022 at Stanford. The talk was on my recent work on stochastic optimal control using techniques from kernel methods.

## Abstract

As autonomy becomes more prevalent, it is increasingly being deployed in highly uncertain environments. This motivates the need for data-driven control methods which are capable of handling complex systems, humans in the loop, poorly-structured disturbances, and also provide assurances of safety. We present a computationally efficient approach for computing stochastic policies based in the theory of kernel embeddings of distributions, a nonparametric statistical learning technique that embeds integral operators as elements in a high-dimensional function space known as a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. We demonstrate how this representation enables us to compute stochastic policies as a linear program, and enables tractability for a wide variety of systems which are resistant to traditional modeling techniques. We have implemented these techniques in a publicly-available toolbox, and apply our approach to motion planning problems and demonstrate its use for computing the safety probabilities for stochastic reachability problems.
