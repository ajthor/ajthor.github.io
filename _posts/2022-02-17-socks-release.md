I have released a new Python package for stochastic optimal control problems using kernel embeddings of distributions. The package is called SOCKS, and is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/ajthor/socks). The package is still in development, but is usable for many problems. Be sure to check out the [documentation](https://socks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
